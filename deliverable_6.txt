The module takes as input an enable bit and a 5-bit address, which serves as the "index" variable into the 32 bit array of output wires. When the enable bit is low, all lines are low. When the enable bit is high, the left-shift operator will move the single high value to the indexed position in the 32-bit array. (The 1 starts at position 0, so when the address, or index, is 0, it does not move; if the address is N the 1 is moved "left" by N positions)
